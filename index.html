                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This website is a cursory exploration of the Bronze Age's rich literary tradition. The literature of the ancient past, as you might expect, has exerted considerable influence over the evolution of literature throughout history. Despite this, many of us are not familiar with its great works, its themes, and its conventions. In an attempt to correct this, I've created this small site to showcase some of the most interesting written products of several ancient civilizations: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Bronze Age of Greece as represented by Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.</p>

                <h2>What was the Bronze Age?</h2>
                <p>Before diving in to the particulars of each civilization's literature, it may be wise to have some background information on the Bronze Age itself. It was a period of history typically considered to have lasted from 3300 BC to 1200 BC. The most significant development of this period was, unsurprisingly, the use of bronze, a sturdy alloy of tin and copper. Bronze was not the first metal used by ancient peoples, but it was considerably harder and more durable than other accessible metals and presented great advantages over peoples without it. Because tin and copper can only be mined in certain places, this began the development of vast trade networks and helped accelerate the centralization of early societies into dense, powerful cities. These cities would produce codes of law, government, religion, and, most importantly for us, systems of writing.</p>
