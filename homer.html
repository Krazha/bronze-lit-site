                <h2>Greece in the Bronze Age</h1>
                <p>Bronze Age Greece was a different place than you might think. In the Bronze Age, the most famous elements of Greek civilization had not yet arisen. The famous Athenian democracy did not exist, nor had Socrates, Plato and Aristotle begun the great project of Western philosophy. The idea that one day a Greek warrior-king named Alexander would spread Hellenic culture across the entire eastern Mediterranean would have seemed incredibly far-fetched to the relatively simple people of the Bronze Age. Their greatest cities, like those of the Minoans and Myceneans, included an incredible level of technological sophistication. Nevertheless, their political structures were not as well-developed, and both civilizations would eventually be destroyed.

                <h2>The Role of Homer</h2>
                <p>The legacy of these Bronze Age cultures is preserved in the ancient world's most famous works of literature. The great poet Homer, who may or may not have been a real individual, created the so-called "Epic Cycle". This was an incredibly lengthy work detailing the exploits of Greek gods and heroes during a long conflict with Troy, culminating in the triumphant return of Odysseus to his homeland in Greece. Much of the cycle is lost to us, but two key pieces remain. The Iliad, dealing with the climax of the war with Troy, and the Odyssey, dealing with Odysseus' journey home. It should be noted that, regardless of whether or not Homer was real, he did not invent the stories of the Epic Cycle himself. Instead, it seems that various pieces of these stories had been passed down as oral traditions in Greece. At the dawn of history's next great era, the Iron Age, someone saw fit to edit and compile these oral traditions into the great works we know today.</p>

                <h2>Remarkable Sophistication</h2>
                <p>Homer's works, widely revered by all the greatest authors of later Greece including the aforementioned philosophical luminaries, are notable for their sophistication and depth. When one reads the Iliad, it is easy to be struck by how modern it seems compared to the literary output of the Mesopotamians or Egyptians. It is concerned with personal relationships and drama, and the characters themselves seem incredibly detailed and thought-out. One example of this can be found in the couple of Helen and Paris. The (in)famous Helen, who started the war by fleeing her Greek husband to be with the Trojan Paris, is consumed by feelings of depression and guilt for what her actions have caused. Her struggle with these feelings is one of the greatest discussions of mental health in the ancient world. Meanwhile, her lover Paris is an effeminate coward who nevertheless struggles to overcome his fears of battle to join his people on the battlefield. Such complicated internal struggles make up much of the Iliad, and even modern readers may see that they have something to learn from the struggles of these characters.</p>
                <p>
                Another famous element of the Iliad is the conflict between the Greek champion Achilles and his king, Agamemnon. Achilles does not care for the war and chastises his king, who steals Achilles' wife in furious retribution. This puts the Greeks at a great disadvantage, and the king ultimately ends up having to make amends with Achilles and grant him great gifts (as well as returning his wife) to save his army from total destruction. This is notable, for Achilles' decision to withhold his support is not portrayed negatively. Instead, the blame is placed on the king, showing a much more sophisticated view of politics than the "big boss is always right" mentality of earlier literature. </p>
