                <h2>Egypt's Religious Literature</h2>
                <p>The Egyptians were another culture in the ancient Near East that developed a profound literary tradition. Like the somewhat older Mesopotamians, they originally developed writing for non-literary purposes. However, they quickly found a crucial use for it: religion. The Egyptian state was deeply intertwined with religion, and almost all of Egypt's most famous relics are religious in nature. The Egyptian religion itself was obsessed with death and the afterlife. It centered on how a person could attain a comfortable and peaceful life after death. Appropriately, our greatest collection of Egyptian literature is known to us today as the "Book of the Dead". It should be noted, however, that this was not its name at the time -- in fact, there was no single "Book of the Dead" in Ancient Egypt. Instead, individuals would have their own books prepared with prayers, stories, and magic spells that they believed were relevant to their own death and funerary preparations. Among these prayers is the so-called "Negative Confession", a recitation of all the sins the speaker did *not* commit. This is a great source on Egyptian morality.

                <h2>The Judgement of Anubis</h2>
                <p>The most famous scene in all of Egyptian literature is the final judgement of the soul. This idea is powerful, with the idea of an eternal soul being judged by God and sent to either a heavenly afterlife or some sort of punishment being a major feature of many modern world religions. According to the Egyptian stories, a person's heart would be weighed by the god Anubis, who would place it on a scale against the feather of Ma'at (which represented justice and order). If the heart was found to be blameless, due to a life lived in accordance with Ma'at, it would be lighter than the feather and the deceased would be allowed to pass into the company of Osiris, lord of the heavenly afterlife. However, if the heart was found to be sinful, it would be heavier than the feather. In this case, the heart would be given to Ammit as a meal. Ammit was a demonic devourer of the dead and destroyer of souls. This great beast is often recorded as presiding over a lake of fire, and those souls whose hearts were eaten by Ammit were condemned to eternal restlessness.</p>

                <h2>The Eloquent Peasant</h2>
                <p>As mentioned, the Egyptians were a deeply religious people, and as such religious ideas and the gods themselves appear in almost all works. However, not all Egyptian literature had a religious purpose. Some appear to be more secular in nature. Most interesting among these is the story of the <span class="modalLink" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#peasantModal">"Eloquent Peasant"</span>. In this story, an unfortunate peasant is abused by a corrupt government official. The peasant complains to a higher authority, but is shunned. In response, he continues to make appeals to the authorities, making ten speeches in total. By the end, the peasant is disgusted with the government officials, promising that he will depart but testify about them "to Anubis." Unbeknownst to the peasant, his speeches were being recorded each day and sent to the Pharaoh. The great king was so impressed by the peasant's eloquence and thoughtfulness that he elevated the peasant to a position of great responsiblity and the corrupt official was punished. This work is notable for being one of the first pieces of literature in world history to so openly discuss the idea of the unfortunate and poor of society being abused and mistreated by government officials. Indeed, it could be considered quite subversive, if not for the fact that the Pharaoh is presented as the only truly just and righteous government figure in the text.</p>

                Your daily rations are in your house; your body is well filled. The officers, who are set as a protection against injustice,---a curse to the shameless are these officers, who are set as a bulwark against lies. Fear of you has not deterred me from supplicating you; if you think so, you have not known my heart. The Silent one, who turns to report to you his difficulties, is not afraid to present them to you. Your real estate is in the country, your bread is on your estate, your food is in the storehouse. Your officials give to you and you take it. Are you, then, not a robber? They plow for you......... for you to the plots of arable land. Do the truth for the sake of the Lord of Truth.You reed of a scribe, you roll of a book, you palette, you god Thoth, you ought to keep yourself far removed from injustice. You virtuous one, you should be virtuous, you virtuous one, you should be really virtuous. Further, truth is true to eternity. She goes with those who perform her to the region of the dead. He will be laid in the coffin and committed to the earth; ---his name will not perish from the earth, but men will remember him on account of his property: so runs the right interpretation of the divine word.
