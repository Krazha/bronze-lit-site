                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>On April 6th, 2023, I did not expect my life to change. I expected the date I had planned for that evening to be uneventful and to ultimately culminate in disappointment. But it didn't. From the very beginning, I felt as though something was pulling us together at that table. It was a little awkward, sure, as all first dates are -- but not unpleasant. Indeed, there was, for me, only a rising sense of <i>rightness</i>. And so it was the next time, and the next, and the next.</p>
                <p>
                    I realize, now, what it was. The immensity of our love, the sheer weight of our possibilities together, was echoing back through the past. It was not, in fact, an ordinary date. It was one of the most extraordinary and central moments of my life, disguised as an ordinary one.
                </p>
                <p>One month later, on May 8th, 2023, I made the best decision I have ever made. But I suspect that even my current estimation of just how spectacularly wise that decision was will, in time, be revealed to be insufficient.

                <h2>A New Vision</h2>
                <p>As a child, I was obsessed with dreams of greatness. Whether as a writer, or a scientist, or even a politician, I idly dreamed of making my mark on the world. I was motivated here, not by any affirmative thinking about what I wanted that mark to be, but only that I wanted that mark to be made. </p>
                <p>I realized later, of course, that that dream was hollow. Vainglorious and prideful visions were shattered not only by reality, but the fading of childhood's acute narcissism. I was left unmoored, uncertain; a lingering dread coiled in the back of my mind, waiting for me in those moments I delved too deply into thought.</p>
                <p>When I was younger, I didn't know what I wanted my mark on this world to be. Now I do. Now I have a new vision, one I hold with far more clarity and determination. Is the vision I have now a humbler one? From the outside, perhaps. Nevertheless, I see it as one far more glorious than any I have ever had before. Fifty years with you will be my monument. Fifty years with you will be my legacy. Fifty years, and many more.</p>
