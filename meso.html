                <h2>A Lament for the Cradle of Writing</h1>
                <p>The ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia were the first we know of to develop writing, and consequently the first to develop written literature. This took longer than you might expect. Writing was originally primarily an accounting tool, used for keeping records and facilitating trade. Only after some time did the Sumerian peoples begin to set down their ideas as literature. Many of these pieces of literature were relatively simple poems. One famous genre of literature from Sumer is the 'city lament', where the writer discusses their grief at the destruction of a city in war. This reflects the fact that literature, as it always has, deals with the things concerning people. For ancient humans, the death and destruction of war was no abstract thing -- it was a frequent experience. This genre would continue to exist for a very long time -- it's possible you've even read one, as the Bible book of Lamentations is considered to be a city lament for the city of Jerusalem.

                <h2>Birth of the Epic</h2>
                <p>The city lament was not the only form of literature developed by the ancient Sumerians. They are also responsible for the oldest known example of epic literature: <a type="button" class="modalLink" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#gilgaModal">the Epic of Gilgamesh</a>. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, we see ancient humans grappling with perhaps the oldest and thorniest philosophical problem, the inevitability of death. After Gilgamesh's friend and adopted brother Enkidu is killed by the gods, Gilgamesh is driven to a morose depression over his feelings that nothing truly matters, as all is impermanent including his own life. He sets out on a quest to find immortality, where he meets a variety of characters and seeks their advice on acquiring immortality. Eventually he finds a plant which supposedly will grant him youth, but it is lost to the sea. Gilgamesh returns to his city after his failure, having come to accept his fate as a mortal man.</p>

                <h2>The Apex of Mesopotamia</h2>
                <p>
                    The Sumerians were not the only Mesopotamian civilization to create literature. Other famous civilizations of the region, such as the Assyrians and Elamites, developed literature of their own. However, none of these compared to the world's earliest center of culture, literature, science, and art. It is a city whose legacy is so great that it is, to this day, used to represent the idea of decadent urbanism: Babylon. Babylon produced many of the period's greatest texts, including a more complete and updated version of the earlier Epic of Gilgamesh, a variety of creation myths that inspired myths across the Mediterranean world, political and philosophical texts, scientific texts, and others. Ironically, very little of this has been discovered from the ruins of Babylon itself. Instead, our best source of Babylonian literature comes from the great Library of Ashurbanipal, found in the Assyrian city of Nineveh, the capital of Babylon's greatest rivals. </p>
