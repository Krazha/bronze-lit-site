                <h2>A New Era</h2>
                <p>I can hardly believe it has been four months since we chose to entwine our fates forever. I remember thinking, at the time, that some people would hear about our decision to get married and think we were moving too quickly. But in all honesty, I had known for months that you were the one for me. If anything, it took too long for the rest of the world to formally recognize that we were already bound together forever.</p>
                <p>Last year on Valentine&apos;s day we hadn&apos;t even lived together yet. Isn&apos;t that bizarre? It hasn&apos;t been even an entire year, yet my life before feels so distant. My memories of being alone feel so short and compressed. I think it&apos;s because life has more content when I&apos;m with you. Each day is richer, fuller, and more meaningful, because each day of my life is contributing to this ongoing project we have to build something together.</p>

                <h2>Leaping Into the Unknown</h2>
                <p>	I&apos;ve known for years that I wanted to leave Florida and go somewhere else, but I never did. I feared being alone, being lost and adrift in a new place. But now I can go anywhere -- because wherever I go, I will bring you with me. Anywhere can be home. That&apos;s a gift you&apos;ve given me. And one that, I hope, I can give to you.</p>
                <p>I think it will be nice to chronicle our time together on this website. Maybe one day we can share it with our children, and at first it&apos;ll be too cheesy for them to bear. But then, give it a little time, and maybe it will help them learn what true love is. They&apos;ll be able to say, "I know exactly what that looks like -- it&apos;s what my parents have."</p>
